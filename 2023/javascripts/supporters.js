Instead of searching for breadcrumbs amongst billions of events, engineers can now ask questions about familiar resources such as customers, containers, builds, tickets, and anything else. Observe maintains a graph of relationships between these resources and how they change over time, which is critical to easily provide context when investigating unknown issues. Finally, because of Observe's unique cloud-native architecture, it is priced based on usage making it up to an order of magnitude less expensive.</p>"
