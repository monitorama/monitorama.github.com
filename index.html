          <p>Get your fitness on! Run, walk, skip, or fly!</p>

          <ul style="text-align: left">
            <li> Where: Start/finish at the NERD Center on Memorial Dr
            <li> When: 2013-03-29T07:00:00-0500 (March 29th @ 7AM)

          <h4> How do I sign up? </h4>

          <p>Signing up will help me record your run times after the race!
          It also gives me a way to contact you in case I need to update
          everyone on changes/etc.</p>

          <iframe src="5k-signup-form.html" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="width:80%; min-height: 2em;"></iframe>

          <p>Just fill out the above, and you'll be good to go!</p>

          <h4> How do I graph it? </h4>

          <p> If it's not monitored, it's not in production! Got iPhone or
          Android? Download the "Strava Run" app. Use this to record your
          efforts during the 5k.</p>

          <h4> What's the route? </h4>

          <p> It's a nice route along on the edge of the Charles River. </p>

          <p> The route starts at the NERD Center along Memorial Dr, and continues along the river until you reach the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=DeWolfe+Boathouse,+Cambridge,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts+02139&hl=en&ll=42.353498,-71.107603&spn=0.001035,0.003549&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.042042,116.279297&geocode=FVRChgIdTvvC-w&hnear=DeWolfe+Boathouse,+Cambridge,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts+02139&t=m&z=19&layer=c&cbll=42.353512,-71.107747&panoid=8V4oaqccEgfsrzswffGoRQ&cbp=12,177.67,,0,-1.36">DeWolfe Boathouse</a>. Once there, double back and retrace your steps along the river back to the start!</p>

          <p> Because the route sends you back the way you came, high-fives with fellow participants are encouraged.</p>

        <section class="welcome">
          <h4>Join us in Boston.</h4>
          <p>We'll be hearing talks from leading open source developers and web operations luminaries, and then taking what we've learned to apply it towards advancing the state of open source monitoring and trending software.</p>

          <h4>Why me?</h4>
          <p>Because you care about the tools that you work with. You're an artisan within your team and want to help improve the work environment for you and your peers. We've all heard that monitoring sucks, but you want to do something about it.</p>

          <h4>Boston in March?</h4>
          <p>You better believe it. The end of March is already in Spring and the weather is starting to warm up. Bring a light jacket and prepare to kick ass.</p>

          <h4>I'm convinced. What now?</h4>
          <p>As of November 21, we've sold out of all general admission tickets. However, you can join our <a href="http://www.monitorama.com/#registration">Waiting List</a> and we'll notify you if any tickets become available.</p>

          <h4>Not Your Average Single-Track.</h4>
          <p>Monitorama takes place March 28-29, 2013 in Boston's NERD Center. Thursday is dedicated to single-track sessions that should educate and inspire you for the activities to come. On Friday plan to roll up your sleeves, break out into workshops to level up your artisanal tools (e.g. Logstash filters, D3.js, etc), or jump right into the hackathon and pair up with a team or hack on your own.</p>

          <div class="hackathon">
            <p><strong>Preparation is key.</strong> Have an idea what you want to work on. Know your tools beforehand so you can dive right in.</p>
            <p><strong>Be flexible.</strong> You might want to go it alone, or decide you want to join a team. Or multiple teams. Or work on multiple tasks by yourself.</p>
            <p><strong>Adjust your scope.</strong> Understand that you're working within the constraints of a typical workday. We're not going to fix the entire Monitoring toolchain in a single day.</p>
            <p><strong>There will be distractions.</strong> You're going to be surrounded by a couple hundred like-minded people who want to share their experiences and wisdom (or ask for yours). Bring headphones if you want some &quot;quiet time&quot;.</p>
            <p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Enjoy the workshops (but not too many). Be inquisitive but focused.</p>
            <p><strong>Enjoy the limelight.</strong> We might ask you to present your work(s) in a 5-minute demo. Embrace the opportunity to share your passion with others. We <span class="heart">❤</span> you and want you to succeed.</p>
            <p><strong>Have fun.</strong> Leave your prejudices at the door. Meet new people and have a great time. We're holding this event to help make things better. You're a part of that now and no one can ever take that away from you.</p>
